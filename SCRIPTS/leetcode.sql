LEFT JOIN Employee e2                  -- Join again to the Employee table using alias e2 representing the manager.
    ON e2.Id = e1.ManagerId            -- Match each employee with their manager by managerId.
WHERE e2.Salary < e1.Salary;          -- Only include rows where the employee earns more than their manager.
