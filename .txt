1. What is the primary purpose of encapsulation in Java?
A) To allow multiple inheritance
B) To wrap data and methods into a single unit and control access to them
C) To improve runtime performance
D) To enable method overloading

(Correct Answer: B) To wrap data and methods into a single unit and control access to them)

2. How do you achieve full encapsulation in a Java class?
A) Make all data members public
B) Make all data members private and provide getters/setters
C) Use only static methods
D) Declare the class as final

(Correct Answer: B) Make all data members private and provide getters/setters)

3. What is the output of the following code?
java
public class Student {  
    private String name;  
    public String getName() { return name; }  
    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }  
}  

public class Test {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Student s = new Student();  
        s.setName("Alice");  
        System.out.println(s.getName());  
    }  
}  
A) null
B) Alice
C) Compilation error (missing constructor)
D) Runtime error

(Correct Answer: B) Alice)

4. Which of the following is an example of a write-only class?
A) A class with only private fields
B) A class with only getter methods
C) A class with only setter methods
D) A class with public fields

(Correct Answer: C) A class with only setter methods)

5. Why is encapsulation important for data hiding?
A) It prevents other classes from accessing private data directly
B) It allows unrestricted access to all fields
C) It makes all methods static
D) It enforces multiple inheritance

(Correct Answer: A) It prevents other classes from accessing private data directly)

6. What happens if you try to override a protected method with a default (package-private) method in a subclass?
A) It works fine because both are similar
B) Compilation error (cannot weaken access privileges)
C) Runtime error
D) The subclass method becomes public automatically

(Correct Answer: B) Compilation error (cannot weaken access privileges))

7. Which access modifier allows visibility only within the same package?
A) private
B) default (no modifier)
C) protected
D) public

(Correct Answer: B) default (no modifier))

8. What is the advantage of using getters/setters instead of public fields?
A) To allow direct modification of fields
B) To add validation logic (e.g., reject negative values)
C) To make the class immutable
D) To avoid inheritance

(Correct Answer: B) To add validation logic (e.g., reject negative values))

9. Which of the following violates encapsulation?
A) Using private fields with getters/setters
B) Declaring a class as final
C) Making all fields public and not using methods
D) Overriding a method with the same access modifier

(Correct Answer: C) Making all fields public and not using methods)
